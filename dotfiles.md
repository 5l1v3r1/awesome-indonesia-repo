Why would I want my dotfiles on GitHub?

* **_Backup_**, **_restore_**, and **_sync_** the prefs and settings for your
toolbox. Your dotfiles might be the most important files on your machine.
* **_Learn_** from the community. Discover new tools for your toolbox and new
tricks for the ones you already use.
* **_Share_** what you've learned with the rest of us.
